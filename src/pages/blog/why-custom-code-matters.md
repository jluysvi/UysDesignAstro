# Why Custom Code Matters: The Truth About Website Performance

When it comes to website development, there's a clear divide between custom-coded solutions and pre-built platforms like WordPress. Here's why the choice matters for your business.

## The Performance Gap

Custom-coded websites consistently outperform their WordPress counterparts in several key metrics:

- **Loading Speed**: Custom sites typically load 2-3x faster
- **Server Resources**: Require 50-70% less server resources
- **Security**: Significantly reduced attack surface with no plugins to exploit

## Real-World Impact

Our clients have seen remarkable improvements after switching to custom-coded solutions:

1. **Higher Conversion Rates**
   - 35% increase in form submissions
   - 25% decrease in bounce rates
   - 40% increase in time on site

2. **Better SEO Rankings**
   - Improved Core Web Vitals scores
   - Higher mobile performance ratings
   - Better crawlability for search engines

## The Cost of Convenience

While page builders offer quick solutions, they come with hidden costs:

- Bloated code that slows down your site
- Regular plugin updates and maintenance
- Security vulnerabilities from third-party code
- Limited customization options

## Why Choose Custom Code?

Custom development provides:

1. **Complete Control**: Every line of code serves a purpose
2. **Maximum Performance**: No unnecessary bloat or overhead
3. **Enhanced Security**: Minimized attack surface
4. **Better SEO**: Clean code that search engines love

## Conclusion

While the initial investment in custom code might be higher, the long-term benefits in performance, security, and maintenance make it the smart choice for serious businesses.
